Subject: RE: SPEI & PPEI Formulas Confirmation

Hi,

Yes, I can confirm the approach used for the normalized indices:

First, %Inhibition is converted to a per_one scale (0.0–1.0) by dividing by 100.

Then the two efficiency metrics are calculated:
- SPEI = per_one / (MW × 0.001) — normalizes activity by molecular weight in kiloDaltons
- PPEI = per_one / (TPSA × 0.01) — normalizes activity by polar surface area divided by 100

The efficiency plane plots SPEI on the X-axis and PPEI on the Y-axis, with the best candidates appearing in the upper right quadrant.

The app also generates histograms for per_one, SPEI, and PPEI distributions to preview data quality before it goes to the Stokes group for AI modeling.

Totally agree — better to validate the data now than discover issues downstream!

Stay warm out there!

Best,
Sharath
